# My testcase for Tractive GmbH.

You can see it here: https://tractive-testcase.vercel.app/

The project used:
- VanillaJS
- SCSS
- Webpack
- Font Avesome
- CSS masks to shape the player
 
I spent about two hours on this task.

PS Since I didn't have a design layout for the player to take icons from or a mask from, it doesn't look pixel perfect, just very similar.
